<h1>Ghoul - Prettier Git For Everyone :)</h1>
<p><a href="http://github.com/georgedrummond/ghoul">Ghoul</a> is a simple yet good looking interface for your git repositories written in <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">sinatra</a>. It is currently only for demonstration purposes and use on your secure local machine as it does not enforce any authentication as of yet.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Ghoul can be run either using the ghoul gem or by downloading the git repository and running through the rackup command.</p>
<pre><code># Installing via rubygems

gem install ghoul
ghoul server</code></pre>
<pre><code># Installing from the git repository
  
git clone http://github.com/georgedrummond/ghoul
cd ghoul
bundle install
rackup
</code></pre>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Ghoul uses the grit, written by the guys at github for parsing your repositories which are located in a folder named "repos" within your
  home folder e.g. /Users/georgedrummond/repos. For git push, ghoul uses grack. Grack has no authentication so ghoul should only be used
  on your local machine.</p>
